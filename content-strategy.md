# CTO Thought Leadership Content Strategy
## Roderik van der Veer | SettleMint

## Executive Summary

Captain has been silent too long. The market is flooded with consultant perspectives (BCG, McKinsey, IBM) but starving for practitioner voices—especially those at the intersection of AI agents and enterprise blockchain.

**Unique positioning:** CTO of an enterprise blockchain platform who has actually built a 20-agent AI system. This combination is rare. Most AI-agent content comes from AI companies; most blockchain content comes from blockchain companies. Captain spans both.

**Goal:** Establish thought leadership through 12-15 high-quality posts over 3 months, focusing on practical implementation over theory.

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### What's Being Published (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

| Source | Content Type | Gap |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| **BCG/McKinsey** | Strategic frameworks, C-suite roadmaps | No implementation details |
| **AWS/IBM/Databricks** | Platform capabilities, enterprise trends | Vendor-biased, not practitioner |
| **Gartner** | Maturity models, predictions | Theoretical, no code |
| **Engineering blogs** | Technical tutorials | Missing business context |

### Captain's Differentiation

1. **Practitioner, not consultant** — Actually built and operates the systems
2. **AI + Blockchain intersection** — Underexplored territory with massive potential
3. **Opinionated voice** — "Vibe coding is killing your team" vs. "Consider AI adoption"
4. **Open source everything** — Shares actual code, prompts, architecture

## Content Pillars (4 Core Themes)

### Pillar 1: AI-Driven Development
*Where Captain has already established credibility*

**Existing content:**
- "How I Built My AI Chief of Staff" (published)
- "The Discipline Gap" (published)

**Topics in this pillar:**
- Engineering workflows with AI agents
- Quality control in AI-generated code
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Cost optimization for AI workloads

### Pillar 2: Enterprise Blockchain Reality
*SettleMint's core domain*

**Market context:** 2025 marked the shift from pilots to production. Companies want practitioner perspectives on what actually works.

**Topics in this pillar:**
- Smart contract platform architecture
- Blockchain in production (not PoCs)
- Enterprise tokenization patterns
- Compliance and auditability

### Pillar 3: Engineering Leadership
*CTO perspective on building and leading technical teams*

**Market context:** Field CTO roles are rising. Engineering leaders want operational wisdom, not management theory.

**Topics in this pillar:**
- Hiring and team structure
- Technical decision-making frameworks
- Startup to scale-up evolution
- Remote/async engineering culture

### Pillar 4: AI × Blockchain Convergence
*Captain's unique intersection—nobody else is here*

**Market context:** IBM mentions "Blockchain + AI integration" as a 2025 trend. Databricks shows 327% growth in multi-agent workflows. But no one is writing practically about the intersection.

**Topics in this pillar:**
- AI agents for smart contract auditing
- Autonomous agents with on-chain actions
- Decentralized AI agent coordination
- Trust and verification in AI-blockchain systems

## Cross-Posting Strategy

### LinkedIn (Primary Distribution)

**Frequency:** Every post + 2-3 micro-posts per week

**Format for blog posts:**
1. **Hook** (provocative first line)
2. **3-5 key insights** (bullet points)
3. **Link to full post**
4. **Question to drive engagement**

**Example:**
```
Most enterprise AI fails. Not because the AI is bad.
Because the discipline was never there in the first place.

After 18 months running AI agents in production:

→ 78% of C-suite say AI needs new operating models (IBM data)
→ 60% of time goes to fixing AI-generated issues (our data)
→ The teams winning aren't prompting better—they're engineering better

5 things consultants won't tell you: [link]

What's blocking your AI deployment?
```

**Micro-posts (standalone LinkedIn content):**
- Behind-the-scenes of Seven of Nine
- Quick takes on industry news
- Lessons learned (single insight, 150 words)
- Polls on technical decisions

### Twitter/X (Amplification)

**Frequency:** Thread for each blog post + 1-2 daily observations

**Thread format:**
1. Hook tweet (the whole thread in one line)
2. 5-8 tweets expanding key points
3. Final tweet with link

**Example thread opener:**
```
I gave an AI agent a wallet and let it trade autonomously.

Here's what happened (and why blockchain is about to change AI forever):

🧵
```

**Daily observations:**
- React to AI/blockchain news
- Share interesting implementations
- Quote-tweet industry figures with takes

### Hacker News / Reddit

**For:**
- Technical deep-dives (Silent Failure Hunter, Multi-Agent Orchestration)
- Open source announcements (when releasing code)

**Not for:**
- Thought leadership / opinion pieces
- Anything that sounds "marketing"

---

## Voice & Style Guide

### Do:
- Lead with strong opinions, then back with evidence
- Share real numbers (costs, time saved, bugs caught)
- Name competitors/incumbents when making points
- Use "I" and "we" — personal experience trumps theory
- Include code snippets, architecture diagrams, actual prompts
- End with actionable takeaways

### Don't:
- Hedge with "it depends" without saying what it depends on
- Use consulting-speak ("leverage," "synergies," "digital transformation")
- Write vendor content masquerading as thought leadership
- Avoid controversy — strong opinions get engagement

### Tone Keywords:
- **Direct** — No throat-clearing, get to the point
- **Opinionated** — Take positions, don't just present options
- **Technical** — Code and architecture, not just strategy
- **Practical** — What actually works, not what should work
- **Human** — Admit failures, share learning moments

## Success Metrics

### Engagement (Monthly)
- Blog: 5,000+ pageviews/month by end of Q1

## Next Steps

1. **This week:** Write "The Consultant's Lie" (Tier 1, highest impact)
2. **Set up:** Cross-posting workflow (LinkedIn/Twitter automation)
3. **Ongoing:** Batch-write 2-3 posts ahead of schedule
4. **Track:** Set up basic analytics (Plausible or similar)
